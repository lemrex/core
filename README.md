## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cbaas-sample.git
cd cbaas-sample
```

### 2. Set up environment variable

Create a `.env` file in each service directory with appropriate variables (DB URL, JWT secret, cloud credentials, etc.)

### 3. Start the backend services

```bash
# In separate terminals or using a process manager
cd auth-service && npm install && npm start
cd account-service && npm install && npm start
cd transaction-service && npm install && npm start
```

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Node.js + Express** for backend services
* **PostgreSQL** (per-tenant databases)
* **JWT** for secure access control
* **Huawei Cloud SDK** for RDS instance provisioning (optional)
* **React or Next.js** for the frontend
* **Bootstrap** or **TailwindCSS** for styling

---

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

* How to build a **multi-tenant architecture** for SaaS
* Dynamic database provisioning and management
* Clean microservice separation of concerns
* Frontend/backend integration in a financial app
* Security best practices using JWT
* Monitoring and observability techniques

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

* Always store secrets (JWT, DB creds) in a secure secrets manager or `.env`
* Use HTTPS in production and restrict DB access via firewalls or private networks
* Add rate limiting and request validation

---

## 📦 Deployment

You can deploy each microservice independently using Docker, Kubernetes, or traditional VM-based hosting. For production-grade deployment:

* Use managed PostgreSQL (e.g. Huawei RDS)
* Configure auto-scaling for services
* Implement centralized logging and monitoring
